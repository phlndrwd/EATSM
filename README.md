# Evolutionary Adaptive Trophic Structure Model (EATSM)

## Description
The code in this repository is a slightly optimised version of that submitted for [PhD in September 2013 at The School of Environmental Sciences, University of East Anglia](https://ueaeprints.uea.ac.uk/id/eprint/48709/1/underwood_thesis_final.pdf). The thesis offers a full write-up of the method, the ecological modelling principles that underpins it, and the analyses and experiements that were initially performed with it. Work on EATSM began in 2010, before C++11 was released and at a time when my C++98 knowledge was more limited. The coding style is one taught during an earlier software engineering role. The code and accompanying User Guide are put here for comparison and my own reference. An improved version of this model is being developed under the name [EATSM2](https://github.com/phlndrwd/EATSM2).
